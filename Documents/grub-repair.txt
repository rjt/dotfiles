Most CentOS6 machines would not boot after the first
intel MeltDown / Spectre patches.  
Every Linux machine was recoverable, but most Windows machines
never booted again, definitely not reliably.  

In CentOS, ~the menu to choose a previous kernel would not even 
appear.  

Eventually figured out booting from a known good CD or ISO
and choosing repair mode:

  # mkdir /mnt/brokenbootpartition
  # mount /dev/xvda /mnt/brokenbootpartition
  # chroot /mnt/brokenbootpartition
  # ls -latr /boot/
  # rpm -qf /boot/vmlinuz latest or in some cases last two. 
  # yum erase $(rpm -qf /boot/vmlinuz latest version)
  #
  # echo yum update might work now if newer patches were out 
  # echo but generally had to use a dracut command 
  # echo to rebuild initrd and stuff.
  # ? dracut command to rebuild the last known good kernel initrd ?
  # echo WHAT WAS THAT dracut command?
  # dracut /boot/initrd-${LAST KNOWN GOOD KERNEL VERSION} or something
  # echo Usually a reboot at this point worked.


The gitorious git server recovered and booted successfully.
But for some reason would have problems.  
  Neglect?

Grub Repair:
  # echo boot into rescue mode againn using CentOS-netinstall

  # mkdir /mnt/LetsFixGrub
  # mount /dev/xvda1 /mnt/LetsFixGrub
  # ls -laNF /mnt/LetsFixGrub/home/   #Sanity Check!
  # chroot /mnt/LetsFixGrub
  # ls -laNF /  # Verify fs is readable but is the correct 
  #    filesystem.

  grub> device (hd0) /dev/xvda      #NOTE THIS IS THE ENTIRE DRIVE
  grub> root (hd0,0)                
  grub> setup (hd0)
  grub> quit
  # sync 
  # exit
  # exit   # should reboot
  # reboot # Boots OS normally or at least gets you back to the grub menu.
